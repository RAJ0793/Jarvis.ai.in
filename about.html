      <h2>üìÇ GitHub</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a platform where developers share their code with the world. It's like a library for projects, where anyone can learn, contribute, or collaborate. If you write code in Python or any other language, GitHub helps you store it safely and show it to others.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
      <p>AI is a technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans. It can help create smart applications like chatbots, image generators, or virtual assistants. AI can analyze data, answer questions, and even create art!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üêç Python</h2>
      <p>Python is a beginner-friendly programming language. It's easy to read and write, and is widely used for AI, web development, and automation. Many AI tools, including Jarvis, are built using Python because of its simplicity and power.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üß† Jarvis</h2>
      <p>Jarvis is a smart assistant, inspired by movies like Iron Man. It can help you manage tasks, answer questions, or run programs on your computer. Some versions of Jarvis can work offline on your PC, making it fast and private.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üé® Local Image Generation</h2>
      <p>This feature allows you to create images directly on your computer using AI, without needing internet. For example, you can generate a drawing or art idea locally. It's fun for creativity and safe for privacy because everything stays on your PC.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üí¨ Local Chatbot</h2>
      <p>A local chatbot is an AI program on your PC that can chat with you. Unlike online chatbots, it doesn't send your messages to the internet. You can ask questions, get answers, or have fun conversations while keeping your data private.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üîß Arduino (Automation)</h2>
      <p>
        Arduino is a popular <strong>microcontroller board</strong> that helps you bring
        electronics and coding together. It‚Äôs widely used by students, hobbyists,
        and professionals to build automation projects like smart lights,
        robots, sensors, and IoT devices.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginner-friendly and affordable</li>
        <li>Works with simple coding (C/C++)</li>
        <li>Can connect sensors, motors, and LEDs</li>
        <li>Perfect for school projects, automation, and prototypes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example: You can make an <em>automatic fan</em> that turns on when the
        temperature rises, or a <em>motion sensor light</em> for your home.
